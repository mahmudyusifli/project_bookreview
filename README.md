# project_bookreview
It is the project for Software Engineering course.
A BOOK REVIEW SOFTWARE IS A SYSTEM DESIGNED TO MANAGE
AND ORGANIZE BOOK REVIEWS, RATINGS, AND COMMENTS. THE
SOFTWARE ALLOWS USERS TO SHARE THEIR OPINIONS AND
RECOMMENDATIONS WITH OTHER READERS, AS WELL AS
DISCOVER NEW BOOKS AND ENGAGE IN DISCUSSIONS ABOUT
BOOKS THEY HAVE READ. THE SOFTWARE ALSO TYPICALLY
INCLUDES A RECOMMENDATION ENGINE THAT USES MACHINE
LEARNING AND DATA ANALYSIS TO RECOMMEND BOOKS TO
USERS BASED ON THEIR READING HISTORY AND PREFERENCES.
THIS CAN HELP USERS DISCOVER NEW BOOKS THEY MIGHT
ENJOY, AND IT CAN ALSO HELP PUBLISHERS AND AUTHORS
PROMOTE THEIR BOOKS TO A WIDER AUDIENCE.
